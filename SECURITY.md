## Reporting a Vulnerability or Security Issue

We recognize that trust is hard to earn and easy to lose. That's why we take security incidents
very seriously and strive to answer all concerns in as timely a manner as we are able. When you
send us a report, we will acknowledge receipt and aim to provide an initial assessment as soon as
possible. Our team is committed to resolving issues promptly.

If you think you've discovered a security concern in Pelican, or if you become aware of any
ongoing malicious activity regarding our software, **please let us know immediately** by emailing
